# evernote-sdk-go
Unofficial Golang library to access Evernote Cloud API.  A core of this library is generated by Apache Thrift code generator.

Codes under "edam" directory is generated by Apache Thrift code generator.  You can do the same by running "batch.sh" script.  However, there are some changes had to be made to make the generated code run correctly.

I am going to add some library code to make coding a bit easier.
