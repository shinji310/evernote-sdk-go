# evernote-sdk-go
Unofficial Golang library to access Evernote Cloud API.  A core of this library is generated by Apache Thrift code generator.

Codes under "edam" directory is generated by Apache Thrift code generator.  You can do the same by running "batch.sh" script.  However, there are some changes had to be made to make the generated code run correctly.

If you like to try this code out, please run the "sample.go".  Before running it, you need to edit the code to place your own "Evernote Developer Token".  The code assumes the sandbox environment, not the production environment.  Be adviced that you do not use your own Evernote production account for development.
